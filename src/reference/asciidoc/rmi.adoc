== RMI Support

[[rmi-intro]]
=== Introduction

This Chapter explains how to use RMI specific channel adapters to distribute a system over multiple JVMs.
The first section will deal with sending messages over RMI.
The second section shows how to receive messages over RMI.
The last section shows how to define rmi channel adapters through the namespace support.

[[rmi-outbound]]
=== Outbound RMI

To send messages from a channel over RMI, simply define an `RmiOutboundGateway`.
This gateway will use Spring's RmiProxyFactoryBean internally to create a proxy for a remote gateway.
Note that to invoke a remote interface that doesn't use Spring Integration you should use a service activator in combination with Spring's RmiProxyFactoryBean.

To configure the outbound gateway write a bean definition like this:
[source,xml]
----
<bean id="rmiOutGateway" class=org.spf.integration.rmi.RmiOutboundGateway>
    <constructor-arg value="rmi://host"/>
    <property name="replyChannel" value="replies"/>
</bean>
----

[[rmi-inbound]]
=== Inbound RMI

To receive messages over RMI you need to use a `RmiInboundGateway`.
This gateway can be configured like this
[source,xml]
----
<bean id="rmiOutGateway" class=org.spf.integration.rmi.RmiInboundGateway>
    <property name="requestChannel" value="requests"/>
</bean>
----

IMPORTANT: If you use an `errorChannel` on an inbound gateway, it would be normal for the error flow to return a result (or throw an exception).
This is because it is likely that there is a corresponding outbound gateway waiting for a response of some kind.
Consuming a message on the error flow, and not replying, will result in no reply at the inbound gateway.
Exceptions (on the main flow when there is no errorChannel, or on the error flow) will be propagated to the corresponding inbound gateway.

[[rmi-namespace]]
=== RMI namespace support

To configure the inbound gateway you can choose to use the namespace support for it.
The following code snippet shows the different configuration options that are supported.

[source,xml]
----
<int-rmi:inbound-gateway id="gatewayWithDefaults" request-channel="testChannel"/>

<int-rmi:inbound-gateway id="gatewayWithCustomProperties" request-channel="testChannel"
    expect-reply="false" request-timeout="123" reply-timeout="456"/>

<int-rmi:inbound-gateway id="gatewayWithHost" request-channel="testChannel"
    registry-host="localhost"/>

<int-rmi:inbound-gateway id="gatewayWithPort" request-channel="testChannel"
    registry-port="1234" error-channel="rmiErrorChannel"/>

<int-rmi:inbound-gateway id="gatewayWithExecutorRef" request-channel="testChannel"
    remote-invocation-executor="invocationExecutor"/>
----

To configure the outbound gateway you can use the namespace support as well.
The following code snippet shows the different configuration for an outbound rmi gateway.

[source,xml]
----
<int-rmi:outbound-gateway id="gateway"
    request-channel="localChannel"
    remote-channel="testChannel"
    host="localhost"/>
----

=== Configuring with Java Configuration

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public RmiInboundGateway inbound() {
    RmiInboundGateway gateway = new RmiInboundGateway();
    gateway.setRequestChannel(requestChannel());
    gateway.setRegistryHost("host");
    gateway.setRegistryPort(port);
    return gateway;
}

@Bean
@ServiceActivator(inputChannel="inChannel")
public RmiOutboundGateway outbound() {
    RmiOutboundGateway gateway = new RmiOutboundGateway("rmi://host:port/"
        + RmiInboundGateway.SERVICE_NAME_PREFIX + "remoteChannelName");
    return gateway;
}
----

Starting with _version 4.3_, the outbound gateway has a second constructor that takes a RmiProxyFactoryBeanConfigurer instance along with the service url argument.
This allows further configuration before the proxy is created; for example, to inject a Spring Security `ContextPropagatingRemoteInvocationFactory`:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
@ServiceActivator(inputChannel="inChannel")
public RmiOutboundGateway outbound() {
    RmiOutboundGateway gateway = new RmiOutboundGateway("rmi://host:port/"
                + RmiInboundGateway.SERVICE_NAME_PREFIX + "remoteChannelName",
        pfb -> {
            pfb.setRemoteInvocationFactory(new ContextPropagatingRemoteInvocationFactory());
        });
    return gateway;
}
----

Starting with _version 5.0_, this can be set using the XML namespace, using the `configurer` attribute.
