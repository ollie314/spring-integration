[[x4.3-new-components]]
=== New Components

==== AMQP Async Outbound Gateway

See <<amqp-async-outbound-gateway>>.

==== MessageGroupFactory

The new `MessageGroupFactory` strategy has been introduced to allow a control over `MessageGroup` instances
in `MessageGroupStore` logic.
The `SimpleMessageGroupFactory` is provided for the `SimpleMessageGroup` with the `GroupType.HASH_SET` as the default
factory for the standard `MessageGroupStore` implementations.
See <<message-store>> for more information.

==== PersistentMessageGroup

The `PersistentMessageGroup`, - lazy-load proxy, - implementation is provided for persistent `MessageGroupStore` s,
which return this instance for the `getMessageGroup()` when their `lazyLoadMessageGroups` is `true` (defaults).
See <<message-store>> for more information.

==== FTP/SFTP Streaming Inbound Channel Adapters

New inbound channel adapters are provided that return an `InputStream` for each file allowing you to retrieve remote
files without writing them to the local file system
See <<ftp-streaming>> and <<sftp-streaming>> for more information.

==== Stream Transformer

A new `StreamTransformer` is provided to transform an `InputStream` payload to either a `byte[]` or `String`.
See <<stream-transformer>> for more information.

==== Integration Graph

A new `IntegrationGraphServer` together with the `IntegrationGraphController` REST service are provided to expose the runtime model of a Spring Integration application as a graph.
See <<integration-graph>> for more information.

==== JDBC Lock Registry

A new `JdbcLockRegistry` is provided for distributed locks shared through the data base table.
See <<jdbc-lock-registry>> for more information.

==== Leader Initiator for Lock Registry

A new `LeaderInitiator` implementation is provided based on the `LockRegistry` strategy.
See <<leadership-event-handling>> for more information.

[[x4.3-general]]
=== General Changes

==== Core Changes

===== Outbound Gateway within Chain

Previously, it was possible to specify a `reply-channel` on an outbound gateway within a chain.
It was completely ignored; the gateway's reply goes to the next chain element, or to the chain's output channel
if the gateway is the last element.
This condition is now detected and disallowed.
If you have such configuration, simply remove the `reply-channel`.

===== Async Service Activator

An option to make the Service Asynchronous has been added.
See <<async-service-activator>> for more information.

===== Messaging Annotation Support changes

The Messaging Annotation Support doesn't require any more `@MessageEndpoint` (or any other `@Component`) annotation
declaration on the class level.
To restore the previous behaviour specify the `spring.integration.messagingAnnotations.require.componentAnnotation` of
`spring.integration.properties` as `true`.
See <<global-properties>> and <<annotations>> for more information.

==== Mail Changes

===== Customizable User Flag

The customizable `userFlag` added in 4.2.2 to provide customization of the flag used to denote that the mail has been
seen is now available using the XML namespace.
See <<imap-seen>> for more information.

===== Mail Message Mapping

There is now an option to map inbound mail messages with the `MessageHeaders` containing the mail headers and the
payload containing the email content.
Previously, the payload was always the raw `MimeMessage`.
See <<mail-mapping>> for more information.

==== JMS Changes

===== Header Mapper

The `DefaultJmsHeaderMapper` now maps the standard `correlationId` header as a message property by invoking its
`toString()` method.
See <<jms-header-mapping>> for more information.

===== Async Gateway

The JMS Outbound gateway now has an `async` property.
See <<jms-async-gateway>> for more information.

==== Aggregator Changes

There is a change in behavior when a POJO aggregator releases a collection of `Message<?>` objects; this is rare but if
your application does that, you will need to make a small change to your POJO. See this <<agg-message-collection>> note
for more information.

==== TCP/UDP Changes

===== Events

A new `TcpConnectionServerListeningEvent` is emitted when a server connection factory is started.
See <<tcp-events>> for more information.

The `destination-expression` and `socket-expression` are now available for the `<int-ip:udp-outbound-channel-adapter>`.
See <<udp-adapters>> for more information.

===== Stream Deserializers

The various deserializers that can't allocate the final buffer until the whole message has been assembled now support
pooling of the raw buffer into which the data is received, rather than creating and discarding a buffer for each
message.
See <<connection-factories>> for more information.

===== TCP Message Mapper

The message mapper now, optionally, sets a configured content type header.
See <<ip-msg-headers>> for more information.

==== File Changes

===== Destination Directory Creation

The generated file name for the `FileWritingMessageHandler` can represent _sub-path_ to save the desired directory
structure for file in the target directory.
See <<file-writing-file-names>> for more information.

The `FileReadingMessageSource` now hides the `WatchService` directory scanning logic in the inner class.
The `use-watch-service` and `watch-events` options are provided to enable such a behaviour.
The top level `WatchServiceDirectoryScanner` has been deprecated because of inconsistency around API.
See <<watch-service-directory-scanner>> for more information.

===== Buffer Size

When writing files, you can now specify the buffer size to use.

===== Appending and Flushing

You can now avoid flushing files when appending and use a number of strategies to flush the data during idle periods.
See <<file-flushing>> for more information.

===== Preserving Timestamps

The outbound channel adapter can now be configured to set the destination file's `lastmodified` timestamp.
See <<file-timestamps>> for more information.

===== Splitter Changes

The `FileSplitter` will now automatically close an (S)FTP session when the file is completely read.
This applies when the outbound gateway returns an `InputStream` or the new (S)FTP streaming channel adapters are being used.
Also a new `markers-json` options has been introduced to convert `FileSplitter.FileMarker` to JSON `String` for relaxed downstream network interaction.
See <<file-splitter>> for more information.

==== AMQP Changes

===== Content Type Message Converter

The outbound endpoints now support a `RabbitTemplate` configured with a `ContentTypeDelegatingMessageConverter` such
that the converter can be chosen based on the message content type.
See <<content-type-conversion-outbound>> for more information.

===== Headers for Delayed Message Handling

Spring AMQP 1.6 adds support for
https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2015/04/16/scheduling-messages-with-rabbitmq/[Delayed Message Exchanges].
Header mapping now supports the headers (`amqp_delay` and `amqp_receivedDelay`) used by this feature.

===== AMQP-Backed Channels

AMQP-backed channels now support message mapping.
See <<amqp-channels>> for more information.

==== Redis Changes

===== List Push/Pop Direction

Previously, the queue channel adapters always used the Redis List in a fixed direction,
pushing to the left end and reading from the right end.
It is now possible to configure the reading and writing direction using `rightPop` and `leftPush` options for the
`RedisQueueMessageDrivenEndpoint` and `RedisQueueOutboundChannelAdapter` respectively.
See <<redis-queue-inbound-channel-adapter>> and <<redis-queue-outbound-channel-adapter>> for more information.

===== Queue Inbound Gateway Default Serializer

The default serializer in the inbound gateway has been changed to a `JdkSerializationRedisSerializer` for compatibility
with the outbound gateway.
See <<redis-queue-inbound-gateway>> for more information.

==== HTTP Changes

Previously, with requests that had a body (such as `POST`) that had no `content-type` header, the body was ignored.
With this release, the content type of such requests is considered to be `application/octet-stream` as recommended
by RFC 2616.
See <<http-inbound>> for more information.

==== SFTP Changes

===== Factory Bean
A new factory bean is provided to simplify the configuration of Jsch proxies for SFTP.
See <<sftp-proxy-factory-bean>> for more information.

===== chmod

The SFTP outbound gateway (for `put` and `mput` commands) and the SFTP outbound channel adapter now support the
`chmod` attribute to change the remote file permissions after uploading.
See <<sftp-outbound>> and <<sftp-outbound-gateway>> for more information.

==== FTP Changes

===== Session Changes

The `FtpSession` now supports `null` for the `list()` and `listNames()` method, since it is possible by the
underlying FTP Client.
With that the `FtpOutboundGateway` can now be configured without `remoteDirectory` expression.
And the `<int-ftp:inbound-channel-adapter>` can be configured without `remote-directory`/`remote-directory-expression`.
See <<ftp>> for more information.

==== Router Changes

The `ErrorMessageExceptionTypeRouter` supports now the `Exception` superclass mappings to avoid duplication
for the same channel in case of several inheritors.
For this purpose the `ErrorMessageExceptionTypeRouter` loads mapping classes during initialization to fail-fast
for a `ClassNotFoundException`.

See <<router>> for more information.

==== Header Mapping

===== General

AMQP, WS and XMPP header mappings (e.g. `request-header-mapping`, `reply-header-mapping`) now support negated
patterns.
See <<amqp-message-headers>>, <<ws-message-headers>>, and <<xmpp-message-headers>> for more information.

===== AMQP Header Mapping

Previously, only standard AMQP headers were mapped by default; users had to explicitly enable mapping of user-defined
headers.
With this release all headers are mapped by default.
In addition, the inbound `amqp_deliveryMode` header is no longer mapped by default.
See <<amqp-message-headers>> for more information.

==== Groovy Scripts

Groovy scripts can now be configured with the `compile-static` hint or any other `CompilerConfiguration` options.
See <<groovy-config>> for more information.

==== @InboundChannelAdapter

The `@InboundChannelAdapter` has now an alias `channel` attribute for regular `value`.
In addition the target `SourcePollingChannelAdapter` components can now resolve the target `outputChannel` bean
from its provided name (`outputChannelName` options) in late-binding manner.
See <<annotations>> for more information.

==== XMPP changes

The XMPP Extensions (XEP) are now supported by the XMPP channel adapters.
See <<xmpp-extensions>> for more information.

==== WireTap Late Binding

The `WireTap` `ChannelInterceptor` now can accept a `channelName` which is resolved to the target `MessageChannel`
later, during the first active interceptor operation.
See <<channel-wiretap>> for more information.

==== ChannelMessageStoreQueryProvider

The `ChannelMessageStoreQueryProvider` now supports H2 database.
See <<jdbc-message-store-channels>> for more information.

==== WebSocket Changes

The `ServerWebSocketContainer` now exposes `allowedOrigins` option and `SockJsServiceOptions` a `suppressCors` option.
See <<web-sockets>> for more information.
